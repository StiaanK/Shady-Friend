So I like to make pixel art, the problem is I am bad with colours, especailly when it comes to lighting and darkening colours. As I did more research I learned about a techinqiue called "Hue shifting". This technique involves changing the HSV/HSB values of a colour. To darken a colour it's hue shifts more towards purple and to lighten a colour it shifts more towards yellow.

Now this is all nice and dandy, but the problem again is I am bad with this and also very lazy. Thus I have decided to create a web app to do this for me! What can possibly go wrong (chances are it is way easier to learn hue shifting by hand than to code it). Currently I am using a website to assist me with hue shifting to lighten and darken colours ([link here]). My goal is to be able to basically create a colour ramp for the colours that I am using for my pixel art instead determining the best colour one by one or atleast provide a basis that I can play around with if need be.

The idea is to have a set patern that for the shading and lighting that I want to use in my art for example the base colour wil be darkened by 15% and then 25% and then 50%, the same goes for lighting it. My first challenge is figuring out how the Hell one would enter a percentage and then perform some colour shenanigans to darken or lighten the colour by said percent...
